# LibraryCatalogerTool
Scan Windows Drive and catalog files to text file.
This application scans the directory that users specify and log the files that it finds to a text file for review.
I initially wrote this to find empty folder, which is a feature i have not added yet. It currently logs everything it finds.

*Future enchancement to the tool that I plan to add
- Find and log empty folders only.
- Ability to select between scanning and logging things such as pictures, movie and/or music.
- Ability to select "Scan All Drives" option.
- Add a UI to the tool for easier user interaction.
